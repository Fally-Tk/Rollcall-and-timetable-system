- `POST /api/submit_attendance.php` - Submit attendance records

#### Student Management
- `GET /api/get_students.php` - Fetch all students
- `POST /api/add_student.php` - Add new student
- `POST /api/update_student.php` - Update student information
- `POST /api/delete_student.php` - Delete student

#### Field Management
- `GET /api/get_fields.php` - Fetch all fields
- `POST /api/add_field.php` - Add new field
- `POST /api/update_field.php` - Update field information
- `POST /api/delete_field.php` - Delete field

#### Timetable Management

### Database Schema
The application expects a MySQL database with the following tables:

- `students` - Student information and parent contacts
- `courses` - Course information
- `timetable` - Weekly schedule entries
- `sessions` - Active rollcall sessions
- `attendance` - Attendance records
- `admin_users` - System administrators

## Synchronization System

### How It Works
1. **Online Mode**: All operations sync immediately with the backend
2. **Offline Mode**: Data is stored locally and queued for synchronization
3. **Background Sync**: Automatic sync attempts every 2 minutes when online
4. **Manual Sync**: Users can force synchronization via the settings page
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins strategy for data conflicts

### Sync Status Indicators
- **Green**: All data synchronized
- **Yellow**: Sync in progress
- **Red**: Pending records waiting for sync
- **Gray**: Offline mode

### Data Persistence
- **LocalStorage**: User preferences and cache
- **IndexedDB**: Attendance queue and offline data
- **Service Worker**: Background sync and caching

## Key Features Explained
